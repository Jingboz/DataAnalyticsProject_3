            The duration of sunlight (solar radiation) in Australia is related to bushfires to a certain extent. Here are some aspects of the relationship between solar radiation and bushfires:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat: Solar radiation provides heat, leading to an increase in temperature on the ground and in the atmosphere. A warmer environment is more conducive to the spread and intensification of fires.</li>
            <li>Dryness: Solar radiation causes water to evaporate, making vegetation and the ground dry. A dry environment is more prone to igniting and spreading bushfires.</li>
            <li><strong style="font-size: larger;">Vegetation growth:</strong> Sunlight and temperature affect plant growth. In areas with high radiation, vegetation grows rapidly and may accumulate a large amount of combustible material. This combustible material, under dry conditions, increases the risk of fires.</li>
            <li>Precipitation: Solar radiation is related to precipitation patterns. Stronger solar radiation may lead to reduced precipitation, increased drought, and consequently higher fire risks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            However, the duration of sunlight is just one of many factors influencing bushfires. Other factors, such as Tree Species in Australia, also have a significant impact on bushfires.
